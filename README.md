# MengProgram1
fastText, CNN, LSTM model based on TensorFlow or Pytorch

# Program Introduction
This program offers English training set and testing set for clustering, the format og the data are：

**label**3 rick denzien rick denzien is a songwriter singer and studio technician from buffalo new york .
**label**14 talking to strange men talking to strange men is a 1987 novel by british writer ruth rendell .
**label**6 porsche 550 the porsche 550 was a sports car produced by porsche from 1953-1956 . label11 mendoncella mendoncella is a genus of flowering plants from the orchid family orchidaceae .
**labe**l5 gino matrundola gino matrundola ( born july 21 1940 ) is a former politician in ontario canada .
······

In the examples above, **label**3 indicate the label of the text "rick denzien rick denzien is a songwriter singer and studio technician from buffalo new york". There is no need to know the exact meaning of **label**3, because it won't affect the final result.
